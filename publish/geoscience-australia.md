So a while back Geoscience Australia stuck this notice on their website,
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Unless otherwise noted, all Geoscience Australia material on this website is licensed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia Licence.</a></p>
Great, another source of free government data. So today when I find a use for some data held on their site I was very dissapointed to see,
<p style="padding-left:30px;">"Please note: Any organisation or individual wanting to use the Gazetteer data in a similar capacity to the Online Place Name Search or any other online application, will require an Internet user licence. (See the Licence Fees and Order Form below)."</p>
So much for the CC-BY license. The latter notice is an "otherwise noted" which says, this data is NOT CC-BY because if you want to use it for such an such purpose you need to get another license to allow you to do that.
