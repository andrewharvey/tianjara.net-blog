What happens when you mix a service like <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/">AustLii</a> with version control system like Git with a wiki like editing system, and deliver it to the people through the web?

Well I haven't tried, but it sounds like a good idea. You get a service that,
<ul>
	<li>allows anyone to propose changes to laws (and work on branches) or draft and new laws, and</li>
	<li>keeps track of the law and when it was changed (and which politicians/parties introduced those changes, who voted for them, etc...).</li>
</ul>
