There are two sources of law.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Statutory Law:
</strong>In Australia Statutory Law is written <strong>law set down by parliament</strong>. Before a law can come into force, the Bill must pass through both Houses of Parliament.</li>
	<li><strong>Common Law:
</strong>“Common law refers to law and the corresponding legal system developed through <strong>decisions of <span class="mw-redirect">courts</span></strong> and similar tribunals (called<strong> case law</strong>), rather than through <span class="mw-redirect">legislative statutes</span> or executive action.
Common law is law <strong>created and refined by judges</strong>: a decision in a currently pending legal case depends on decisions in previous cases and affects the law to be applied in future cases. When there is no authoritative statement of the law, <strong>judges have the authority and duty to make law by creating precedent</strong>.” –Wikipedia</li>
</ul>
Statutory law trumps common law.

In Australia, the legal system can be broadly classified into 4 different jurisdictions:
<ul>
	<li>Criminal Jurisdiction</li>
	<li>Civil Jurisdiction
<ul>
	<li>Contract Law</li>
	<li>Tort Law</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Administrative Jurisdiction</li>
	<li>Equity</li>
</ul>
Litigation refers to the process of a lawsuit (when you take someone to court).
<ul>
	<li>The burden is on the party bringing the action (the Plaintiff)</li>
	<li>Litigation can be costly and something to be avoided</li>
	<li>Consider mediation and arbitration for civil matters</li>
</ul>
<strong>Punitive damages </strong>(in contrast to <span class="mw-redirect">compensatory damages</span>) are damages not awarded in order to compensate the plaintiff, but in order to reform or deter the defendant and similar persons from pursuing a course of action such as that which damaged the plaintiff.

In the area of Contract Law, clicking an OKAY button on a webpage or during installation is legally binding!

In the lecture we took a look at the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/documents/useterms/Windows%20Vista_Ultimate_English_36d0fe99-75e4-4875-8153-889cf5105718.pdf">Microsoft Windows Vista License Agreement</a>. Though I think the <a href="http://images.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/iphone.pdf">iPhone License Agreement</a> is worth taking a look at too.
