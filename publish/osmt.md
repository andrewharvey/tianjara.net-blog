I feel the map style I've been working on recently is in good enough shape to announce. It is written in carto and designed to be used with OpenStreetMap data. It is an overlay layer for aerial imagery, though in my example I use NearMap imagery.

Take a look at <a href="http://tianjara.net/osmt.html">http://tianjara.net/osmt.html</a>.

There is still lots of work to do on it though.

I also have a lightweight cycle-overlay too (view example at <a href="http://tianjara.net/leaflet.html">http://tianjara.net/leaflet.html</a> and tick on the cycle overlay or view the code at <a href="https://gist.github.com/1216315">https://gist.github.com/1216315</a>)
