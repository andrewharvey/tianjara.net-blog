Title: All rights reserved and Creative Commons together?

Just noticed that a book I was reading over is apparently "Copyright All rights reserved." and Creative Commons licensed at the same time, I thought that they conflicted? There is probably some legal reason, but it seems a bit weird and confusing to me. Its also not the first time I've come across something like this.

EDIT: Maybe it means that we start off with all rights reserved, and from there give you some exceptions or exclusions to these reserved rights. But, well at least in Australia you have "All rights reserved" unless you state otherwise, making it redundant.
