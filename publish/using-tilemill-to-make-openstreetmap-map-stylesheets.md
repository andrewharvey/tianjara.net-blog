A short time ago TileMill got support for PostGIS data sources. I'm really excited by this as it means you can use TileMill, which is very easy to use, having a gentle learning curve, to construct your own OpenStreetMap stylesheets and see the data being rendered using your style. This is great! e.g. in less than an hour I made this,

Want a map which just shows the drainage network (which you can see from low zooms)? Easy.

I'm sure I'll be publishing lots of new styles in the near future, one of which will be a style designed as an aerial image (NearMap) overlay. Exciting times ahead...
