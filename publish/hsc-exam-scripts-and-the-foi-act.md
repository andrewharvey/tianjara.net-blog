In the past week (more like a month now) or so I've had a few requests asking me how I got access to my <a href="http://andrew.harvey4.googlepages.com/">exam scripts</a> (i.e. my exam responses) and how they (having just completed their HSC) could access theirs. In light of this I thought I would explain why I think exam scripts should be accessible to the student.

About a year ago I made a request for my HSC examination scripts under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/foia1989222/index.html"><em>Freedom of Information Act 1989</em> (NSW)</a>. The process for submitting a FOI request is documented by the Board <a href="http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/administration/foi_application.html">here</a>. I was granted copies of these documents[my exam scripts]. In the past people have requested things such as raw marks, I did request those too but that was denied for me. You should note that the Board may or may not grant access to these documents in the future.

Now to why I think students should have access to their scripts, which is mainly because it makes the whole process more transparent (even US President Obama is pressing this with <a href="/blog/attachments/2009/01/2009foia-mem-rel-_2_.pdf">his recent FOIA memo</a>). There should be nothing to hide, students should be able to check what they wrote in the exam. They should be able to publish this along with how their response was marked so that it can be scrutinised and studied by future students. I'm not convinced that this is the best study approach in the long term but that is no excuse for disallowing access to scripts. It would also be great if students could also find out how their questions were marked on a question by question basis.

However I can see reasons why the Board would not want to release exam scripts. It is time and money consuming. Even if the process is automated it still costs money and some time. For this I would accept why the Board would charge a reasonable fee for giving you your scripts.

The Board of Studies is doing the right thing here, they did allow my FOI request so I cannot argue that they are hiding them. Kudos to them for this. I hope two things to happen now, more people become aware that they can get their scripts, and the Board continuing to allow these requests.
