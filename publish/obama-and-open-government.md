In a recent memo from US President Obama to The Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
<blockquote>"The presumption of disclosure also means that agencies should take affirmative steps to make information public. They should not wait for specific requests from the public. All agencies should use modern technology to inform citizens about what is known and done by their Government. Disclosure should be timely." <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/propublica/assets/docs/2009foia%20mem%20rel%20_2_.pdf">http://s3.amazonaws.com/propublica/assets/docs/2009foia%20mem%20rel%20_2_.pdf</a></blockquote>
... lets hope this gets pushed more and more into Australian Government. Actually I don't really know how open our government is but I think it could do better. Just a thought, I shall look into this some more.
