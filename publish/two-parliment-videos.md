Two parliamentary videos I thought I would share...

Remark 1. It seems that from the <a href="http://webcast.aph.gov.au/livebroadcasting/">offical source</a> you can only stream live, you cannot download past videos.

Remark 2. On another note I checked the licensing of the official parliamentary videos.

</a></blockquote>
I'm interested if "[y]ou may ... reproduce          this material in unaltered form only..." grants you the right to reproduce it as part of a larger derivative work, whilst not altering the copied segment. I think it should, but this is not clear enough in my opinion. Secondly "personal use" is a bit ambiguous. There are no references made to "personal use" in the <em>Copyright Act 1968</em>, so I'm wondering if this implies that one cannot republish this material for others to use. Again I think this should be allowed but it is unclear.
