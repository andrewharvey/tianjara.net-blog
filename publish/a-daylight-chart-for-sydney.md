Alright I'm here doing something I told myself I wouldn't, that is double post (you would have noticed this if you subscribe to my Github RSS feed). But I feel that I have a wider audience here than on my Github RSS feed.

Anyway I recently put together a daylight chart using some existing tools. You can<a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~amha119/daylight_chart/graph.html"> see it here</a>. Here is the static image version (the one in the link is drawn with JavaScript and has some interactivity). This is for 2010 in Sydney in Sydney's timezone.

PS. I don't know what those jumps in March are, look into the DateTime::Event::Sunrise perl module for the answer.
