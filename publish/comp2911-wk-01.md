A few random things I've picked up this week that I think are noteworthy.

To my understanding,
<ul>
	<li>jre - Java Runtime Environment (of which the jvm (Java Virtual Machine) is an instance):
When you compile a Java program Java bytecode is produced, not machine code. The JRE/JVM is used to convert this Java bytecode into machine code so that the program can run. This allows Java programs to be run on whatever platform you have a JRE for.</li>
	<li>jdk - Java Development Kit:
This is the compiler that produces Java bytecode from your Java source.</li>
</ul>
--------------------------------------

Some indicators of Good Design,
<ul>
	<li>Don't notice it/less obvious/doesn't draw your attention</li>
</ul>
Some indicators of Bad Design,
<ul>
	<li>Unnecessary effort to get it to do what you want it to do</li>
	<li>Not fulfilling it's purpose for its intended audience</li>
</ul>
--------------------------------------

Eclipse and NetBeans are both IDE's. They pretty much do the same thing. Though NetBeans is made by Sun.

I think these two slides from <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2911/09s1/lectures/1.pdf">Potter's notes</a> sum things up nicely.

<pre>   Point p = null;
   p = new Point(1, 2);
   System.out.println(p.getCoord());</pre>
