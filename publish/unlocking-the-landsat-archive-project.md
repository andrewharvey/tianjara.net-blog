The impacts of the Geoscience Australia switch to Creative Commons licensing is starting to take more shape. With much better quality licensing statements and notices appearing with new works they publish.

The licensing of the AGRI has allowed members of the public to on their own autonomy make and release derived works such as agri.openstreetmap.org, or the OSM edits which use it. GA must have problems hosting the huge amount of data themselves (because you can only obtain it via DVD), no problem the CC licensing has allowed the public to do a better job with <a href="http://agri.openstreetmap.org/download/">hosting it online</a>.

<a href="https://gist.github.com/3294610">I've done a similar thing</a> for the The National Dynamic Land Cover Dataset.

In other news I've just learnt about the <a href="http://ga.gov.au/earth-observation/accessing-satellite-imagery/future-of-landsat-archive.html">Unlocking the Landsat Archive project</a>. This is interesting because "Within this project, Geoscience Australia will transfer itâ€™s archive of Landsat data to the NCI and make it freely available under a creative commons licence."

Aiming to be completed by June 2013, lets hope they make both the raw data and standard derived products available. All under CC-BY or CC0, and all through a documented API which developers can use to access the data.

Finally I've found <a href="http://earthengine.google.org/">http://earthengine.google.org/</a>. I'm really impressed. It is really easy to use, you just select the satellite and your date and up on your web map you get the collected imagery overlaid.

All this raster work has rekindled my interest in remote sensing.
