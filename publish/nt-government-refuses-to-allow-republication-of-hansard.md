Title: NT Government Refuses To Allow Republication of Hansard

It's sad but I'm not surprised. Not only does this reinforce that the Government does not want you republishing what they say in Parliament sessions (as per their copyright statement on their web site), but they are not even willing to grant specific rights to specific groups for specific intentions.

Hi Steve

I am writing to you from OpenAustralia in your capacity as the contact for the NT Parliamentary Hansard as per <a href="http://www.nt.gov.au/lant/hansard/hansard.shtml">http://www.nt.gov.au/lant/hansard/hansard.shtml</a>

We are a group of volunteers who run a website, <a href="http://www.openaustralia.org/">http://www.openaustralia.org</a> which republishes the Hansard from Federal Parliament in a user friendly searchable format. We also support email alerts and rss feeds by keyword.

In future, as well as the Senate and the House of Representatives, we're also intending to republish the State and Territory Parliament Hansards in the same format, making it even easier for all Australians to have access to their elected Representatives and be easily informed of Parliamentary proceedings at all levels.

Specifically in this case we'd like to republish the NT Parliamentary Hansard at <a href="http://www.openaustralia.org/">www.openaustralia.org</a>

Hi Katherine,

Please note that authority has been given for you to link only to our Hansard &amp; Legislation page or more specifically the Parliamentary Record databases on that page as per the Hansard link below. Unfortunately, authorisation has not been given to republish Northern Territory debates in another format.

Should you require any further information, please feel free to contact me.
