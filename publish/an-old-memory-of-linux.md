Title: An old memory of Linux

I only started using Linux when I started Uni (2008). I knew nothing about it prior to this. I had heard of it but that is all. I now wish I'd become aware of it sooner but then I realised I had the chance. A friend of mine introduced me to it in year 10 (2005) and I even got an Ubuntu 4, 5 or 6 CD (I can't recall which one). But I never used it. Why not? Well, it occurred to me that Windows was the sole reason for me not at least testing Linux out. I had had some bad experiences with some Windows operating systems and installing windows operating systems. So I had the thought "I don't want to risk breaking my computer/loosing things again with another OS install" just to test this Linux thing out. Huge mistake! Though at least I've learnt from this experience and I'm trying to try things out and give them ago before I just assume them to be poorer quality or choosing not to use them.

One of the best pieces of advice that I would give is to try new things out, if you don't try it you won't know what your missing. For if I was always too afraid to try new things out I would still be using Windows 95.
