I post these here for the purpose of future reference and use.

ï»¿<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1968133/s41.html">...for purpose of criticism or review</a>

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1968133/s41a.html">...for purpose of parody or satire</a>

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1968133/s42.html">...for the purpose of, or is associated with, the reporting of news by means of a communication...</a>

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1968133/s43.html">...for the purposes ... of a report of a judicial proceeding. </a>

They are "Acts not constituting infringements of copyright in works". So I'm just reminding myself of these rights so that any time I wish to use material covered by these, I can just grab the text and link from here and note it next to the copy. Of course this is not really relevant here because this blog is hosted by a US company, but it would be help if I were to one day decide to self host in Australia.
