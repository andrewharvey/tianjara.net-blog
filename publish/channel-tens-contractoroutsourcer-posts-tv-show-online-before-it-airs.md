It seems that channel ten (or at least their contractor/outsourcer/whatever) decided to release episodes of a show its airing (Merlin) on the interent before their have aired on TV. Its not such a big deal because the show has already aired in the UK, but I would still say good on you channel 10 for going that extra mile and supporting the fans who want to watch the show through legal methods.

The links are (its a 13 episode season),

But they are sure to change, esp the dates (but they were valid when I posted them (wget -S --spider filename, will verify if a file exists for you)), so you may need to change them (the dates) (ps. DownThemAll is great at trying many different file names to see which ones get a hit). On ten's web site they only list the most recent episode but if you look at your HTTP logs you can see the flv URL. There is no key in the file so you should be able to just change the episode number and then try all dates in the near months.

PS. In the odd chance than someone from TEN reads this you should note that Australia has poor interent (in terms of IP quota) as such we have a greater need to be able to download shows and watch later (so the download can be done off peak, or from a location with more generous IP quota). You should consider promoting friendly file formats straight for download. Perhaps then you will have a larger uptake of online viewers (I would find a short advertisement at the start and/or end of the video acceptable).

PSS. I'm not one of those people who thinks posting links to pirated material should be (or is) illegal or immoral. Among many other reasons, how is the person who posts the link supposed to know if the material they are linking to is infringing?

PSSS. This is not a vunrability and as such I don't think I am required under my own ethics to let them know. But regardless this is obviously intentional, and dispite all this I cannot report it to TEN anyway as there is no email listed on their <a href="http://ten.com.au/contact-us.htm">contact us</a> page.
