The OSM license change seems to be hitting a climax. OSMF are meant to be culling the database and shifting to their new license about now.

NearMap are continuing down a different path now that they had been previous, seeming making it harder (and perhaps dropping the clause altogether..?) to derive data and publish it under the CC-BY-SA license.

Bing imagery traced data in OSM/FOSM is marching ahead.

I can't seem to keep up with it and stay on my two feet any more.

I'm this close to putting my head in the sand and letting it all blow over and seeing how my sand castle of work I've put into OSM and FOSM stands after the storm.

Perhaps I should shift gears and focus on something completely different until then.
