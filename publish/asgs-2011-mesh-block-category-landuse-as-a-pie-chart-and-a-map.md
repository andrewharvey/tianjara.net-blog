Looking at the <a href="http://tianjara.net/leaflet.html#lat=-28;lon=133;zoom=5;map=asgs-2011-mb">ASGS 2011 mesh blocks geographically</a>, most of the landmass of Australia is classified as Agriculture (I am aware that the mesh block category which is used here isn't a definitive land use, purely an indicator of the main planned land use of the mesh block...). Only a few coastal areas, the hills between Vic and NSW at the South East (I should really know the proper name... better have the name added to (F)OSM!) and West Tasmania are Parklands.

Using <a href="https://gist.github.com/3192345">some scripts I wrote</a>, I present a <a href="http://tianjara.net/misc/mesh-block-graphs.html">graph of the mesh block total area by category</a>.
